function [Coeff_full] = coeffs_conj2full(Coeff_part,row_idx,col_idx, ordering, type)
% COEFFS_CONJ2FULL
%
% This function computes the full coefficients with ordering specified
% in the input array with the same name, given the coefficients in conjugate
% ordering up to the conjugate center index. It is used in a cellfun of
% conj2lex as well for the autonomous computation.
%
% [Coeff_full] = COEFFS_CONJ2FULL(Coeff_part,row_idx,col_idx, ordering, type)
%
% Coeff_part:   coefficients in conjugate ordering up to conjugate center
%               index
% x_idx:        option to change coordinate directions (for symmetry of
%               reduced dynamics coefficients
% y_idx:        conjugate center index at the order of the coefficients
% ordering:     array that converts conjugate to other ordering
% type:         type of coefficient that is reconstructed
%
% Coeff_full:   full coefficients in ordering specified by the array
%               ordering
